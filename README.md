Hey there! I decided to make a starcraft 2 strategy guide, similar to liquipedia, but done in my own flavor.

I am an avid player (platinum 1 terran) and I think the information is hard to access in order to become a better player.

This project was done during Spring 2025 for Dr. Kubiak's CSC437 Dynamic Web development class at Cal Poly.

You can view the website deployed on https://ebuttram.csse.dev. It follows HTML first principles, with some Node/TS for the light and dark mode switch.

Mobile support was also built in. The images, icons, and switches all work and scale for a variety of screen dimensions.

The project was built and deployed using NPM and the NPM http-server, tested both over local network and localhost.
