    <h1>3-Rax With 1-1-1 Stim Timing</h1>
    <p>This is a great all arounder and very safe build in lower leagues because of how many units you will have early on</p>

        <li>Build order</li>
        <img src="../../../images/3raxBuildOrder.png" style="aspect-ratio:auto; width:50vw;"></img>
        <li>NOTE TO ETHAN THIS BUILD ORDER IS WAY OUT OF DATE</li>
        <li>The opener is quite simple. Be sure your first depot should be made at the 17-18 second mark</li>
        <li>The SCV depot will make the first barracks. Tip: use an Engineering bay to line up the 3x3 unit barracks for your wall</li>
        <li>The Build will also require a quick refinery right after the Barracks, once the refinery is done, saturate it with 3 SCV's</li>
        <li>once your barracks is done, make a reactor and make your Main CC an orbital, at this point nothing will be producing so make a CC in the natural and wall off with a depot against zerg</li>
        <li>Here you have some freedom, use the Barracks SCV for a scout, at lower levels, keep it home and make a CC in the natural, it doesn't hurt to make a bunker in the natural against zerg cheese</li>
        <li>while you are floating money, build your other 2 barracks and put tech labs on them as soon as they are done</li>
        <li>once the tech labs complete start stim, combat shield, and build an engineering bay</li>
        <li>the engineering bay will start weapons level 1, by this time you should have a healthy marine force with stim and combat almost done... attack with 12-16 marines</li>
        <li>these marines' survival is up to your micro skills, but it will get you some scouting info as well as do some damage if you are lucky</li>
        <li>build 2 more refineries</li>
        <li>back home, build a factory, start a reactor on it, and build a starport</li>
        <li>swap the factory and starport and start a reactor again on the factory</li>
        <li>the starport should begin medivacs as soon as possible</li>
        <li>against zerg, make some hellions, otherwise, once the factory reactor is done, swap it for a barracks tech lab</li>
        <li>congratulations, this build will take you well into platinum league. In bigger macro games, this is the time to make a 3rd CC and build more barracks, but for now, a solid 2 base all-in will do the trick</li>
        <li>some considerations: your CC's should be MULEing and making workers almost the entire time</li>
        <li>same goes for the barracks. You should never lack marine production. If buildings arent making stuff, they're being wasted</li>
        <li>lastly, practice against Easy AI to nail down your early game. It won't train you against cheese or early aggression but your build order will be on lock</li>

        <li>Note: This is a general TvX matchup build order, zerg and terran will be fine but you will want to get some marauders (4-6) with concussive shells against protoss</li>
